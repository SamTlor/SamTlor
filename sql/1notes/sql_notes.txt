homework due 10/31          (monday)
quiz 4 11/2                 (wednesday after that)




creating tables
CREATE TABLE {relation name} (
    {constraint name}           {constraints}
);
makes a table called {relation name} with any constraints set up that you want



constraints are things like
    AUTO_INCREMENT
    varchar(num)
    decimal(num)
    char(num)


ALTER TABLE : takes months of planning just don't do it for this class
                alters the structure after it's already running



INSERT INTO {relation anme} VALUES ({values})
inserts a new row with the values matching any order that was specified


UPDATE {relation} SET {column} WHERE {predicate} 
UPDATE relation SET this change or whatever WHERE something like id = 123
update normally will change every thing in the table so use WHERE to only change specific things
changes things that already exist
can have logic like when and else statements



DELETE FROM {relation} WHERE {predicate}


TRUNCATE TABLE {relation}
won't do in this class prolly
removes all rows from a table

DROP TABLE {relation}
deletes a whole table



distinct means unique data like no duplicates for a certain value
concat combines two values
