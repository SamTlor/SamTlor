//HOW TO MAKE FILE AND RUN IT
// to create a new directory and file use:
//cargo new [name]

// that creates a folder called [name]
// to run use:
//cargo run





//HOW TO KNOW INFO ABOUT THIS PROGRAM. LIKE DEPENDENCIES 
// Cargo.toml 
//the manifest file for Rust. 
//Itâ€™s where you keep metadata for your project, as well as dependencies.

// to add dependencies
//after the "[dependencies]" line add [dependency name] = "[version number]"
//or in a terminal use: cargo add [dependency name] and then cargo build

// cargo.lock
//this is a log of the exact versions of the dependencies we're using locally

// to import the dependency or specific functions use:
//use [dependency name]::*;
//use [dependency name]::[dependency function];
//use [dependency name]::{[dependency1, dependency2]};

use ferris_says::*;
use std::io::{stdout, BufWriter};





//CLASSES
//to instantiate a class use: stuct [Name]
//to define the class use impl
struct Class;
impl Class {

    //FUNCTIONS
    //to define a function use: fn
    //to make it public use: pub
    //to make it private use: priv

    //to specify return type use: -> [type]
    //to maybe specify a return type or not use: Option<[possible type]>
    fn hello() -> Option<String> {

        if false {
            Some("to have a function with the return type Option you have \
                    to return a Some() or a None".to_string())
        } else {
            //print! for same line 
            print!("He");
            print!("ll");

            //println! for a new line after
            println!("o ");



            //all together this prints out 'Hello \n'
            None
        }
    }
}





//VARIABLES
//use the let keyword
//variables are immutable by default unless you use: mut
//type is inferred if you want to say what type use: :[type]
//you can use a variable to redeclare a variable that is immutable
//constants are always immutable and must have a specified type
//scope is limited to the {} that a variable is defined in

//bulit in variable types are integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, characters, 
//                            and compound types like tuples and arrays/vectors

fn world(){
    //setting a variable equal to single quotes means it's a char
    let comma: char = ',';

    //setting a string variable with double quotes makes it a string pointer
    let ending = " w";

    //so to use it later you have to use to_string() on it
    //but if you use it on one part of an additional thing you don't need to 
    // use it for anything in the rest of the line. this is me using a variable
    // to redeclare a variable that is immutable
    //so for this comma needs a to_string() but ending doesn't
    let ending = comma.to_string() + ending + "orld!\n\n";

    //this is how you do f strings
    //there is no other type of print statement
    println!("{}", ending);





    //this is how you create the other TYPES of variables
    // _ before the variable to let compiler know it's unused on purpose
    let _number: i32 = 42; // Signed 32-bit integer
    let _is_true: bool = true; // Boolean
    let _character: char = 'A'; // Character
    let _float_number: f64 = 3.14; // 64-bit floating-point number
}





fn arrays() {
    
    //this is how you create ARRAYS [type; length]
    //arrays have a fixed size at compile time
    let mut numbers: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    //this is how you ACCESS THE ARRAY AND CHANGE IT but only if it is mutable
    println!("First element: {}", numbers[0]);
    numbers[0] = 0;
    println!("First element again: {}", numbers[0]);
    println!("All elements: {:?}", numbers);

    //this is how you access a SLICE from the array (exclusive)
    println!("Some elements: {:?}", &numbers[0..3]);





    //this is how you create VECTORS Vec<type> 
    //vectors don't have a fixed size at compile time
    let mut numbers: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();

    //this is how you ADD to vectors if it is mutable
    numbers.push(1);
    numbers[0] = 0;
    numbers.push(3);

    //this is another way to define a vector
    let numbers: Vec<i32> = vec![1,3];

    // Access individual elements
    println!("First element: {}", numbers[0]);
    println!("Second element: {}", numbers[1]);

    // Print the whole vector
    println!("All elements: {:?}", numbers);

    //Print a partial vector (exclusive)
    //the first way is more memory efficient because the second way creates
    //  a new vector out of the old one whereas the first way is a slice, which
    //  is not the same thing as a vector. it's only a view of the data
    println!("Some elements: {:?}", &numbers[0..1]);
    println!("Some elements: {:?}", numbers[0..1].to_vec());
