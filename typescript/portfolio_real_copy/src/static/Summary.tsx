                I'm a fullstack developer that just graduated with a bachelors degree in Computer Science. I 
                gained experience from an internship and a full time job. So far I've worked on prompt 
                engineering for custom AI bots, integrating APIs to safguard sensitive information, and 
                implementing AWS services.
