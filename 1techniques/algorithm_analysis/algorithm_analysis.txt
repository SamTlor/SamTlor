Brute Force:
Start with a simple, straightforward solution.
Enumerate all possible solutions and choose the best one.

Two Pointers:
Use two pointers to traverse the data structure.
Often used in sorted arrays or linked lists.

Sliding Window:
Maintain a subset of elements within a "window" that moves through the data.
Useful for problems involving intervals or subarrays.

Hashing:
Utilize a hash table or set to store and look up values efficiently.
Useful for counting frequencies or checking for duplicates.

Binary Search:
Apply binary search to a sorted data structure to find a specific element efficiently.
Useful in problems with sorted arrays or searching.

Dynamic Programming:
Break down a problem into subproblems and solve them independently.
Store intermediate results to avoid redundant computations.
Useful for optimization problems and many combinatorial problems.

Greedy Algorithm:
Make locally optimal choices at each step to achieve a globally optimal solution.
Often used in optimization problems.

Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS):
Traverse or search through a data structure using DFS or BFS.
Useful for graph-related problems and tree traversal.

Topological Sorting:
Sort the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) based on their dependencies.
Useful in scheduling or ordering problems.

Divide and Conquer:
Divide a problem into subproblems, solve them independently, and combine the results.
Useful for problems that can be broken down into simpler instances.

Backtracking:
Systematically explore all possible solutions and backtrack when necessary.
Useful for problems with multiple solutions or combinatorial problems.

Binary Search Tree (BST):
Utilize the properties of a binary search tree for efficient search, insertion, and deletion.
Useful in problems involving ordered data.

Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union):
Maintain a collection of disjoint sets and efficiently perform union and find operations.
Useful in problems involving connectivity and disjoint components.

Bit Manipulation:
Manipulate individual bits in an integer for efficient solutions.
Useful in problems involving bitwise operations.

Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's, Floyd-Warshall, etc.):
Apply specific graph algorithms based on the requirements of the problem.
Useful for solving various graph-related problems.

Linear Programming:
Model an optimization problem with linear relationships and solve it using linear programming techniques.
Useful for certain optimization problems.

Branch and Bound:
Divide the problem into subproblems, solve them, and prune branches based on certain criteria.
Useful for optimization problems with discrete or combinatorial solutions.

Randomized Algorithms:
Introduce randomness to solve problems with uncertain input or to approximate solutions.
Useful in situations where deterministic algorithms may be impractical.
