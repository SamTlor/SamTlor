export default vs export
export default: file name has to match variable being exported
export: needs a {} around the thing you are importing 



in react jsx code is different from html code



To create a react project:
    npm create vite@latest [project title] -- --template react
    cd [project title]
    npm install
    npm run dev

OR

    npx create-react-app [project title]





STRUCTURE
node_modules folder holds packages
public folder holds assets that will displayed to user. like images




PROPS
properties are react's version of parameters
props are expected to be an object
get object variables with dot notation
props.[child] child is the name of the variable in the jsx that called 



PROPS AND CHILDREN
you can pass jsx elements as props too
    function Bag(props) {
        return (
            <div>
                {props.children}
            </div>
        )
    }
    export default Bag

    function Pears(props) {
      return (
        <h2>I don't like pears, but my friend, {props.friend}, does</h2>
      )
    }

    <Bag children={<Pears friend="Peter" />} />



ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS
works the same as a normal prop but now can be called with its variable name
has to be a const variable

    const Nav = function(props) {
        return (
            <ul>
                <li>{props.first}</li>
            </ul>
        )
    }
